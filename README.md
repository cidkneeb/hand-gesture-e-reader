6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

Designed it for those who need an online e-reader with special accessibility features. For anyone who wants to read books online, but also accessible to those who can't easily navigate menus and buttons.


7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
-open hand and point: flip to next page
    Open hand gesture mimics the action of flipping a page, making it intuitive for reading, while also pointing at page so it’s a definitive gesture, and they dont flip on accident.

-close hand and point: flip to previous page
    It’s like holding a page and pulling it back, making it a natural gesture for reversing the next page action. Closing hand is the natural inverse for opening hand. 

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?

-Clarity and Consistency: The buttons are descriptive and have a consistent theme, navigation is at a bar on the bottom. 

-Error Prevention and Handling: I tried to keep similar gestures seperate, if open hand activates something, I didn't do something else that also involves open hand, because the two can easily activate each other and I needed to prevent user frustration.
